# RPL Simulation

This repository contains the Python code for simulating the Routing over Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) protocol. The simulation uses SimPy, a discrete-event simulation framework, to model the behavior of nodes within a low-power lossy network, specifically focusing on the dynamics of RPL's routing mechanisms.

## Features

- **Neighbor Discovery**: Nodes dynamically discover neighbors based on a specified connection range.
- **DODAG Formation**: Implements the RPL's DODAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) formation using DIO (DODAG Information Object) messages.
- **Prefix Distribution**: Utilizes DAO (Destination Advertisement Object) messages for the distribution of network prefixes.
- **Trickle Algorithm**: Controls the timing of DIS (DODAG Information Solicitation) messages to optimize network traffic.
- **Network Disruptions**: Simulates network disruptions and node recovery to test the robustness of the network.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- SimPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arman-bd/rpl-simulation.git
```

### Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install simpy matplotlib
```

## Configuration
Modify the simulation parameters in `simulation.py` according to your needs. You can modify default values directly in code or when launching the script.

- **RANDOM_SEED**: Random seed for reproducibility.
- **NUM_NODES**: Number of nodes in the simulation.
- **AREA_WIDTH, AREA_HEIGHT**: Dimensions of the simulation area.
- **CONNECTION_RANGE**: Maximum range for connecting to other nodes.
- **DIO_INTERVAL**: Interval at which DIO messages are sent.
- **NODE_CREATION_INTERVAL**: Interval at which nodes are created in the simulation.
- **RUNTIME**: Duration of the simulation.

## Usage

To run the simulation, execute the script `simulation.py`:

```bash
python simulation.py
```

The simulation will generate a plot showing the node distribution and the DODAG connections. Additionally, diagnostic outputs including node creation, neighbor discovery, and message exchanges are printed to the console and saved to a file named output.txt.

## Visualization
The generated plot will illustrate nodes as points on a grid with lines connecting them to represent parent-child relationships in the DODAG. Each node's ID and the IPv6 prefix are displayed next to the corresponding node on the plot.

## Output
* A PNG image of the node distribution and connections named output.png.
* A detailed log of the simulation process saved to output.txt, including timestamped events such as DIS and DIO message exchanges, and DAO message propagation.
